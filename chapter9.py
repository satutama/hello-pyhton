# Pyhton dictionaries

# What is a Collection
# we can put more than one value in it and carry them all around in one convenient package
# we have a bunch of values in a single 'variable'
# we do this by having more than one place 'in' the variable
# we have ways of finding the different places in the variable 

# List is a linear collection of values that stay in order
# Dictionary is a 'bag'of values, each with its own label

# Dictionaries are python's most powerful data collection
# Dictionaries allow us to do fast database-like opration in Python
# Dictionaries have different names in different languages
    # Associative Arrays - Perl/PHP
    # Properties or Map or HashMap - Java
    # Property Bag  C# / .Net
