    and in particular where there are multiple tables and the relationships between those tables involed in the query.

        Relation (or table) - contains tuples that have the same attributes
        Tuple (or row) - a set of fields that generally represents an "object" like a person or a music trac
        Attribute (also column or field) - on of possibly many elements of data corresponding to the object represented by the row
