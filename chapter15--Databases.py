Relational Databases
    Relational databases model data by storing rows and columns in tables.
    The power of the relational databases lies in its ability to efficiently retrieve data from those tables
    and in particular where there are multiple tables and the relationships between those tables involed in the query.

    Terminology
        Database - contains many tables
        Relation (or table) - contains tuples that have the same attributes
        Tuple (or row) - a set of fields that generally represents an "object" like a person or a music trac
        Attribute (also column or field) - on of possibly many elements of data corresponding to the object represented by the row


SQL - Structured Query Language
    Language we use to issue commands to the databse
    . Create a table
    . Retrieve some data
    . Insert data
    . Delete data

Web Applications w/ Databases
    . Application Developer - Builds the logic for the application, the look and feel of the application - monitors the application for problems
    . Database Administrator - Monitors and adjusts the database as the program runs in production
    . Often both people participate in the building of the "Data model"

Database Model 
    or database schema is the structure or format of a database, described in a formal language supported by the database managbement system.
    In other words, a 'database model'is the application of a data model when used in conjunction with a database management system.

Common Database Systems
    Three major Database Management Systems:
    . Oracle - Large, commercial, enterprise-scale, very very tweakable
    . MySql - simpler but very fast an scalable - commercial open source
    . SqlServer - very nice - from microsoft

    Smaller projects, free and open source
    . HSQL, SQLite, Postgres,...
