Data on the web
    . There are 2 commonly used formats: XML and JSON to represent data going between aplication and across networks
    . When we take the data from internal representation (python dictionary for example) and send it to the 'Wire', it's called serialization
    . When we receive the data from the wire, we need to deserialize it (from XML or JSON), it's called deserialization
